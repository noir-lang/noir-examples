# Noir Examples


This is a reference repo to help you get started with writing zero-knowledge circuits and applications with [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/).

Each project is an example you can use for whatever you want. Feel free to mix them in order to find the best combination of technology that suits your needs.

## Examples

### End-to-End Integration Examples

- **[Solidity Example](./solidity-example)** - Complete workflow: Noir circuit → JavaScript proof generation → Solidity on-chain verification
- **[Recursion](./recursion)** - Demonstrates recursive proof generation where one circuit verifies another circuit's proof
- **[Web Starter](./web-starter)** - Browser-based proof generation with Vite, Webpack, and Next.js bundler examples
- **[Stealthdrop](./stealthdrop)** - Privacy-preserving airdrop using PLUME nullifiers, ecrecover, and Merkle trees

### Library & Feature Examples

- **[Bignum Example](./bignum_example)** - Using `noir-bignum` library for BLS12-381 field arithmetic
- **[Base64 Example](./lib_examples/base64_example)** - Base64 encoding/decoding with gate count benchmarking
- **[Noir by Example](./noir_by_example)** - Noir syntax examples side-by-side with Rust equivalents (loops, generics, macros)

## Starter

You can view simpler, boilerplate projects that are good templates for starting your own Noir project in the [Noir Starter](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter) repo.

## OpenAI Codex

If using [OpenAI Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex/) add the following to your environment, so that the agents can run `nargo` and `bb` commands.

Make it so that it can run the startup script.

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/setup-all.sh
./scripts/setup-all.sh
```

And turn on internet access. Giving access to "Common Dependencies" and this specific url should be sufficient, `aztec-ignition.s3.amazonaws.com`.
