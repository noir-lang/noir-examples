# Noir Examples

This is a reference repo to help you get started with writing zero-knowledge circuits and applications with [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/).

Each project is an example you can use for whatever you want. Feel free to mix them in order to find the best combination of technology that suits your needs.

- Solidity Example: [`./solidity-example`](./solidity-example)
- Recursion: [`./recursion`](./recursion/)

## Starter

You can view simpler, boilerplate projects that are good templates for starting your own Noir project in the [Noir Starter](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter) repo.
