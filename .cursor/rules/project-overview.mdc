# Noir Examples Project Overview

This repository contains example projects demonstrating how to write zero-knowledge circuits and applications using the Noir programming language.

## Key Components

- **Solidity Example**: Located in [solidity-example/](mdc:solidity-example), demonstrates Noir integration with Solidity smart contracts
- **Recursion**: Located in [recursion/](mdc:recursion), shows how to implement recursive proofs in Noir
- **Noir by Example**: Located in [noir_by_example/](mdc:noir_by_example), contains basic Noir programming examples
- **Stealthdrop**: Located in [stealthdrop/](mdc:stealthdrop), demonstrates stealth drop functionality using Noir
- **Lib Examples**: Located in [lib_examples/](mdc:lib_examples), shows how to use Noir's standard library

## Project Structure

Each example project typically contains:
1. Noir circuits (`.nr` files)
2. Integration code (e.g., Solidity, JavaScript)
3. Tests
4. Documentation (README.md)

## Getting Started

For simpler, boilerplate projects, refer to the [Noir Starter](mdc:https:/github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter) repository.
